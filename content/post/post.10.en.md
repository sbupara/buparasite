From a young age, my curiosity about the inner workings of the human mind and my fascination with social consciousness has led me on an incredible journey. My passion for understanding the intricacies of the human brain and the social structures that surround us propelled me to pursue a degree in philosophy of mind and social science at UC Berkeley. Under the guidance of esteemed American philosophers John Searle and Hubert Dreyfus, I delved deeper into the complex world of human behavior and the ways in which we interact with one another.

After obtaining my undergraduate degree, I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Professor and Researcher Stanley Klein, a quantum-physicist turned visual neuroscientist at UC Berkeley. Klein quickly became my mentor and guide, and it was through him that I discovered the excitement of academic research. For six years, I worked alongside Klein as a research assistant and lab manager, honing my skills in project management and the business side of research.

During my time in the lab, I also became fascinated with the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As someone with a strong background in computer science and finance, I was drawn to the potential of this disruptive technology and the impact it could have on emerging markets. My career took a new turn as I transitioned from the practice of research to the business of research, managing multi-million-dollar research portfolios in academia.

As my career progressed, I realized that there was still so much more to learn. I made the decision to pursue an MBA with a focus on the intersection between disruptive technologies and emerging markets in the new digital economy. This has allowed me to expand my knowledge and expertise in a rapidly-evolving field, while also developing a new set of skills to help me navigate the complex world of business and innovation.

Throughout my journey, I have come to understand the importance of curiosity, adaptability, and the willingness to take risks. By embracing these qualities, I have been able to carve out a unique path for myself and make a meaningful impact in the world of research and technology.

Since obtaining my MBA in 2022, I have been leveraging my over 15 years of experience in research finance to provide specialized consulting services to academic and nonprofit organizations. My years of experience in the fast-paced research and technology space have taught me the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. This is especially true in the world of finance, where new technologies and emerging markets can quickly disrupt traditional business models. Through my consulting services, I help organizations navigate this complex landscape by providing expert advice on everything from financial strategy to risk management. 

The types of projects my clients typically request my assistance with fall into the following categories: 

> Pre-Award: finding, writing, budgeting, and submitting proposals
> Post-Award: award setup, subaward setup and tracking, fund management, reconciliations, and award closeouts
> Administration: financial journals & accruals, month-end & fiscal-year close, payroll administration and adjustments, accounts recievable, accounts payable, invoicing, risk assesment, internal controls, compliance management, and audit support

In addition to providing consulting services, I'm always on the lookout for new entrepreneurial opportunities in the exciting world of disruptive technologies and emerging markets. I'm currently working on several exciting projects that showcase my passion for combining cutting-edge tech with traditional business practices.

One of my latest endeavors is a book I'm writing that will provide simple, easy-to-follow Python recipes for machine learning in business and marketing. It's designed to help professionals with little to no experience in programming to take advantage of the power of machine learning to enhance their work and stay ahead of the competition.

I'm also collaborating with a team of experts to develop innovative AI-based tools that make the grant writing process more efficient and effective. As someone who has spent years working in research finance, I know firsthand how time-consuming and challenging grant writing can be. That's why I'm excited to work on a solution that will help organizations of all sizes to streamline this critical process and focus more on what they do best.

And of course, my interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to burn bright. I love sharing my knowledge with others and regularly host online and in-person talks and tutorials for beginner to intermediate users. Whether you're curious about the basics of blockchain or want to learn more about the latest developments in the world of decentralized finance, I'm always happy to chat and share my insights.

As someone who's always looking to learn more and take on new challenges, I'm open to collaborative projects and excited to explore new opportunities. So if you have any questions or want to discuss potential collaborations, don't hesitate to reach out! Together, we can work to create innovative solutions that will make a real difference in the world of business and technology.
